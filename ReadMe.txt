# OAuth 2.0 Implementation
This repository contains a full implementation of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, including a Client, Authorization Server, and Resource Server. This project is designed to provide a foundational understanding of how OAuth 2.0 works and can be adapted or extended for specific use cases.
# Introduction
OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization. It allows third-party applications to grant limited access to a userâ€™s resources without exposing credentials. This project demonstrates a basic OAuth 2.0 flow with the following components:

## Authorization Server: Responsible for authenticating the user and granting access tokens.
## Resource Server: Hosts the protected resources and validates the access tokens.
## Client: Represents the application that requests access to the resources on behalf of the user.
